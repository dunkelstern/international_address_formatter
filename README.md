# International Address formatter

This is a address formatter that can format addresses in multiple formats that are common
in different countries.

For formatting the addresses the `worldwide.yml` from [OpenCageData address-formatting repository](https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting) is used to format the address according to customs in the country that is been encoded.

See `README.md` in the [repository](https://github.com/dunkelstern/international_address_formatter) for more information.
